# PHP developer recruitment task

## Description

Imagine that a customer approached you with a request to create a simple service for importing a list of products from a CSV file and enabling basic product management. They provided you with the following CSV file (sample_products.csv) containing a sample list of products.

Your task is to create a straightforward solution, a service written in PHP 8.2, and using the latest version of the Symfony framework or its components.

## Requirements

Your solution must meet the following conditions:

- Have a CLI command for importing data from a local CSV file or a file from a remote location, depending on the URL provided by the user.
- Have CRUD (API) endpoints for managing products (REST + JSON). Implement pagination and the ability to filter products for collection retrieval endpoints.
- Implement unit tests and integration tests for the solution.
- Provide API documentation in OAS (Swagger) format, available as either a YAML file or with the help of the NelmioApiDocBundle library.

**Bonus:**

- Prepare a development environment for Docker Compose.

## Guidelines

- Remember about SOLID and Clean Code principles that you are familiar with
- You can either create a completely custom solution or make use of open-source libraries available on the internet.
- Place the created solution in a GitHub repository and share the repository link with our HR team
- If you encounter any challenges along the way, please add a comment detailing the biggest issue.

_Good luck!_
